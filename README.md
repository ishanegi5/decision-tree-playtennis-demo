🌤️ Decision Tree on PlayTennis Dataset (Demo Project)
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier on the classic PlayTennis dataset.
The dataset is small (14 records) and is widely used in ML courses to illustrate how decision trees split categorical attributes using Entropy and Information Gain.

The main goal is conceptual understanding, not high accuracy.

📂 Project Highlights

Dataset: PlayTennis (tiny categorical dataset)

Model: DecisionTreeClassifier (scikit-learn)

Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

📊 Results

Since the dataset is very small, the results are not meant for real-world performance.
The purpose is to show:

How decision trees split features

How GridSearchCV tunes hyperparameters

How to interpret confusion matrix & classification reports

🚀 How to Run
git clone https://github.com/ishanegi5/decision-tree-playtennis-demo.git
cd decision-tree-playtennis-demo
jupyter notebook decision_tree_play_tennis.ipynb

📖 Learning Takeaway

This project is intended as a teaching/demo project to understand the working of Decision Trees on categorical data.
For practical applications, check out larger projects (Iris, Titanic, Heart Disease, etc.) in my GitHub profile.
